## uinput-injector

Written because I locked myself out of my desktop and didn't have
a keyboard on hand. I needed to log myself in and `startx` so I could
switch to synergy. So I wrote this as a shim...

If you want to adopt this to your own needs, feel free. Its just
a matter of adjusting the `programmed_input` array in `config.h`.
