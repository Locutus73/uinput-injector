## uinput-injector

Written because I locked myself out of my desktop and didn't have
a keyboard on hand. I needed to log myself in and `startx` so I could
switch to synergy. So I wrote this as a shim...

Uinput-inject reads input from its command line, for example:

```
sudo ./uinput-inject Hello
```
